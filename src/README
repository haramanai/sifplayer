This is the main source of the project.

sifobject.js is the main object that will read the sif.xml andcreate the layers to render.

All the other javascript files are Layers.

Also there is a build file that if you run it it will compile those src files with google closure compiler to the build/sifplayer.js file.


If you add an extra layer you will have to added to the build file to be compiled.
